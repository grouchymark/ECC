<br><strong>Mission Statement</strong>
<br> 
<br>Since the incorporation of the Evanston Car Cruise in 1996 as a Wyoming non profit 501 (C)3 corporation, the mission and goal of the car club has been to provide new winter shoes and coats to Evanston and Mountain View school children in need from grades K through 12 at no charge.
<br> 
<br>The Evanston Car Cruise club members volunteer their time to take children shopping at no charge and receive no monetary compensation of any kind. All the members volunteer their time to make this annual event occur. <br><br>This last winter (2017/2018) the car club spent over $1400.00 on new winter shoes and coats for 23 Evanston and Mountain View school age children.
<br> 
<br>Winter 2018/2019 will mark the 23rd consecutive year for the car club winter shoes and coats program, and depending on how cold the winter and how depressed the local economy is, the car club may spend as much as $3,000.00 on winter shoes and coats.
<br>
<br>Since 1996, the Evanston Car Cruise car club has spent over $67,000.00 on this charity, with all monies spent right here in Evanston and Mountain View to help our local school age children in need.
<br> 
<br>Thank you for your consideration of our cause.
<br> 
<br>E. Kerry McIntyre

<div>
</div><div>The summer of 1988 found four hot rod “junkies” talking about starting a local car club where guys with the same interests could get together and work on their street rods, share ideas and skills, go cruising and to car shows and just hang out. In July of 1988 they started Small Town Toys with five charter members -- Ray Landry, Cole Deister, Steve Folliet, Russ Easton and Rick Ludwing, along with their wives.  New members were nominated by the charter members, then voted on by the group, after a month’s “get to know you” period. There was a small membership fee and club jackets for members designed by Rick Ludwing. Cars had to be 20 years or older to qualify. This was set up as a family-oriented club.
</div><div>
</div><div>During the colder months, the guys worked on their cars and helped each other in their shops. As a club we also got together for holiday parties -- Halloween, Christmas, Valentine's Day, etc. During one of our winter meetings, Gordon Marrs was a guest and he was interested in a fund raiser for the Special Olympics kids in Evanston. He purposed a Car Show to be put on by our club for street rodders in this area to raise funds for this project. So began the Annual Evanston Charity Car Show in the summer of 1989.
</div><div>
</div><div>&nbsp;In the mid 1990’s Gary Harvey was working at a local car dealership in Evanston and admired the cars and members of our “local” car club, "Small Town Toys" and especially the car show that they held annually at Hamblin Park in August each summer. As a dealership sales manager and an amateur promoter, Gary approached the members of Small Town Toys to hold a “mini” car show, with food and awards at the dealership each spring. The event was a total success for both parties each year, and enjoyed by all in the community. Unfortunately, an internal problem developed within the car club and Small Town Toys was no more.  
</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</div><div>As a non-club member, Gary felt that it was a shame for good friendships and people to melt away. With some help from founding Small Town Toys member and good friend Russ Easton, a few changes were made and with a simple new edict addressing a past issue and charity for glue, they both felt that new life could easily be breathed into the club again.</div></div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pl-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><br>Fortunately, most members just jumped right in, and the re-born car club's first new season held two car shows. DJ-ing the shows for several years was done by David B Smith from Evanston's local radio station KEVA. Later Donna Simpson was able to help the car club obtain the services of JC Hackett and his rock n roll racket, and JC is still spinning the wax and emceeing the car show today.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p></p><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>A very important tool, a 5O1 (C)3 IRS classification was undertaken by club member Sheila Hockett. This was  accomplished, and with support from Jim Davis of the Urban Renewal committee. a meeting place for the club was also arranged. Dennis Poppinga from the Evanston Parks and Rec. helped secure an annual date at Hamblin Park to hold our car show, the annual "Show 'N' Shine."
</div><div>&nbsp;
</div><div>Many local business owners sponsor and support the car show and club in many ways. 2016 will be the 21st annual Evanston Car Cruise car show. and as always, it will be held on the first Saturday in August in Hamblin Park.
</div><div>
</div><div>All of the car club members are volunteers and their only pay is in the satisfaction of providing a much needed charity in their home town for the needy local school kids here in Evanston.
